# EquationalTest

From the main folder:
- `lake exe cache get`
- `lake build`

Then start VS Code and open `EquationalTest/Basic.lean`.

We currently get a warning after `lake exe cache get` and for some reason the build takes a long time (it seems to recompile parts of Mathlib), but otherwise, it works.
